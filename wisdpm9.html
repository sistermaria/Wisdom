	<h3>Wisdom 9 </h3>
<strong>	<div>'God of our ancestors, Lord of mercy, who by your word have made the universe,</div></strong>
<strong>	<div>and in your wisdom have fitted human beings to rule the creatures that you have made,</div></strong>
<strong> <div>to govern the world in holiness and saving justice and in honesty of soul to dispense fair judgement,  </div></strong>
<strong>	<div>grant me Wisdom, consort of your throne, and do not reject me from the number of your children. <div></strong>
<strong>	<div>For I am your servant, son of your serving maid, a feeble man, with little time to live, with small understanding of justice and the laws.</div></strong>
<strong>	<div> Indeed, were anyone perfect among the sons of men, if he lacked the Wisdom that comes from you, he would still count for nothing.</div></strong>
<strong><div>With you is Wisdom, she who knows your works, she who was present when you made the world; she understands what is pleasing in your eyes and what agrees with your commandments</div></strong>
<strong>	<div> Despatch her from the holy heavens, send her forth from your throne of glory to help me and to toil with me and teach me what is pleasing to you;</div></strong>
<strong><div>And who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom and sent your holy Spirit from above?</div></strong>
<strong><div>Thus have the paths of those on earth been straightened and people have been taught what pleases you,</div></strong> 
<strong><div>and have been saved, by Wisdom.'</div></strong>
